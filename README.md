# Personal-Projects
This is a folder of some small, personal projects.

'545_Project.Rmd' was a project I worked on for a statistical computing course. We used simulated annealing to find approximately correct solutions to the traveling salesman problem. The markdown file includes ggplot visualizations.

'CerealLinearReg.py' is a simple project I did to get acquanted with the basics of pandas and scikit-learn. I used the 'cereal.csv' dataset to fit a linear regression model used to predict the rating of cereal based on nutrient amounts such as fat, protein, fiber, etc. The dataset required some cleaning as well as standardizing. The model acheives an R-squared value of about .95. 

'PewDataExploration.R' does some basic exploratory analysis on a recent Pew Research poll regarding favorability of different religions in America. This uses tools from dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. I intend to add prior surveys to investigate the change in attitudes over time.
