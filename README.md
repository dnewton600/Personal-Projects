# Personal-Projects
This is a folder of some small, miscellaneous projects.

'545_Project.Rmd' was a project I worked on for a statistical computing course. We used simulated annealing to find approximately correct solutions to the traveling salesman problem. The markdown file includes ggplot visualizations.

'PewDataExploration.R' does some basic exploratory analysis on a recent Pew Research poll regarding favorability of different religions in America. This uses tools from dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. I intend to add prior surveys to investigate the change in attitudes over time.
